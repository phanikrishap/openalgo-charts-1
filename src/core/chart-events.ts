/**
 * The chart's event bus: every name `chart.on(...)` takes, the payload each
 * carries, and the registry behind `on`, `once`, `off` and the engine's emit.
 *
 * {@link ChartEventMap} is the one inventory of the bus. The engine emits each
 * name in it, except the three a host emits for a link group (`symbol`,
 * `interval`, `chartType`); tests/chart-event-map.test.ts holds every emit and
 * subscription in src to it with the compiler. A lazy tier adds its own names
 * by declaration merging (the draw tier's are in src/draw/events.ts), which is
 * also how a host types an event of its own:
 *
 * ```ts
 * declare module 'openalgo-charts' {
 *   interface ChartEventMap { 'myapp:signal': { price: number } }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Names. A new name is `namespace:action`, lower case, words joined by a
 * hyphen, in the present tense (`objects:change`, `draw:preview-clear`). The
 * names that predate the rule (the camelCase pane and indicator events, the
 * single words, `trading:*` in snake case, and the past tense of
 * `branding:changed`, `timezone:changed`, `alerts:changed` and
 * `alerts:restored`) keep their spelling: renaming one would break every
 * listener on it.
 *
 * Payloads. One shape per name. An event with nothing to say carries an empty
 * object ({@link EmptyEvent}), except `events:change`, which has always carried
 * `undefined`.
