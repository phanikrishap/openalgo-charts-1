/**
 * The widget shell: a chart with its chrome, built in one call.
 *
 * `createWidget(container, options)` puts a `.oac-widget` root into the
 * container with a top bar, a stage (the tool rail beside the chart) and a
 * status line, creates the chart and the drawing controller inside it, wires
 * the keymap, the overlay stack and the toasts, and hands every mounted piece
 * one `WidgetContext`. A host that wants the chart alone still has the engine;
 * this is for the host that wants the terminal.
 *
 * Three decisions worth recording:
 *
 * - **The shell owns the theme, the symbol and the interval; the chart owns
 *   everything else.** The engine has no instrument concept, so symbol and
 *   interval live here, drive the feed from here, and are published on the bus
 *   as `symbol` and `interval` for a host (or a link group) to follow.
 * - **Persisted state is validated field by field and applied to the dataset
 *   it was captured on.** A viewport is a range of bar indices and means
 *   nothing on different bars, so a saved layout landing on another symbol
 *   keeps its indicators and panes and drops its view. Its drawings belong
 *   to the symbol it was saved on (`drawingScope`): each instrument keeps its
 *   own, and a layout from before that attaches its drawings to its symbol.
 * - **Every chord goes through one keymap in the capture phase.** The rail,
 *   the editing keys and the tool chords register there with a scope, so a
 *   dialog being open or the focus being in the rail is decided once, not in
 *   every listener.
