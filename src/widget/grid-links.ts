/**
 * The chart grid's link groups: which charts link with which, on which
 * channels, and how a group reads and writes itself in a workspace.
 *
 * Each group is one engine `LinkGroup` (crosshair, time range, symbol,
 * interval, chart type, appearance) and one draw tier `DrawingLinkGroup`
 * that the link group's drawings switch lets each member join. A chart is in
 * one group or in none. The grid starts with one group holding every chart,
 * which is the whole desk linking as it did before groups existed, and it
 * writes a workspace exactly as it did then until the user makes a second
 * group, names one or takes a chart out.
 *
 * Three decisions carry it:
 *
 * - **A group lasts as long as its charts.** The grid drops a group the
 *   moment its last chart leaves, so no group keeps an instrument, interval or
 *   chart type nobody is showing for the next chart to adopt: a new group
 *   starts from the chart that makes it.
 * - **A group's letter is its own.** Letters are handed out as groups are
 *   made and kept, so group C stays C when group B empties; colour follows the
 *   letter and never carries the meaning alone.
 * - **Older readers get only what every chart can follow together.** With
 *   groups written, the flat channels a reader from before groups applies to
 *   the whole desk are on only when one group holds every chart; otherwise
 *   they are all off, which can neither refuse a desk nor pull one chart onto
 *   another's instrument.
