/**
 * Date and range navigation for a host: load the history a request needs
 * through the host's own loader, then place it with the chart's public
 * viewport and time conversion. DOM-free, so the packaged widget and a custom
 * host apply one set of rules.
 *
 * Three decisions carry it:
 *
 * - **A date names a bar by its calendar day, not by its stamp.** Daily bars
 *   arrive stamped at local midnight, at the session open or at UTC midnight,
 *   so a typed date is before its own bar in two of those three. Bars a day or
 *   longer are therefore counted from the local midnight of their first day;
 *   shorter bars keep their stamp, and an instant in an overnight or weekend
 *   gap moves to the next session.
 * - **History stays contiguous.** Missing history is older bars prepended to
 *   what is loaded, never a detached window, because the gapless axis would
 *   draw a detached window as if it continued straight into the live tail.
 * - **The placement is the last thing that happens.** It runs after the
 *   accepted load and only for the request, instrument and chart it was made
 *   for, so an obsolete answer cannot move the view and a later refresh keeps
 *   the anchor it finds.
